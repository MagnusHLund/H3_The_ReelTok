# The ReelTok client

This directory includes client-side applications, for our social media.

It is expandable to include additional technologies as client-side, such as ReactJS.
The reeltok.client.common directory includes files which are shared with all client side apps.
This is to reduce duplicate files, when performing tasks such as maintenance.
